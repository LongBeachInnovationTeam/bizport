  <h2>Differences Between Licenses, Permits, and Inspections</h2>
  <strong>Licenses:</strong>
  <p>Licenses are the city’s way of keeping track of businesses. They establish a legal connection between businesses and their owners, and regulate certain types of commerce. The license fee helps cover the cost of services like police, fire.</p>
  <strong>Permits:</strong>
  <p>Permits are proof that your building and facilities follow city rules ("code") and are safe for you, your employees, and your customers.</p>
  <strong>Inspections:</strong>
  <p>As you complete each phase of construction, you'll need to have city inspectors visit to ensure that the work meets Long Beach's health and safety standards. Most inspections are performed before approval of a business license.</p>

  <h2>City Business License Types</h2>

</p>
    <h3>Costs by license type</h3>
<p>
If you have more than one business license at the same location, you may choose to pay for all employees on one license. If so, you will pay for the employees on the license with the higher employee rate.

  <h2>Short Term Licenses</h2>
  <p>
    If your business location is in another city and you plan to do work in Long Beach, you are required to purchase an ‘out of city’ business license. The City recognizes the work may not last an entire year and offers pro-rated term licenses in three month increments.

    <h3>
      Alcohol Beverage Control (ABC) License 
  </h3>
  <p>
    Any person wishing to obtain an alcoholic beverage license should apply at the nearest office of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. All parties concerned, applicants for new licenses or transferors (present licensees), and transferees (applicants) should be present. It is desirable for an employee of the Department to advise all applicants in person of pertinent laws, rules, and regulations. Also, in the case of a transfer, the transferee may desire information regarding a temporary retail permit.

This is a state license.
  </p>
  {{ cms:partial:shared/link_box:"http://www.abc.ca.gov/":"READ":"ABC's website" }}
  <p>
    The district office that covers long beach is located in the City of Lakewood
  </p>
  {{ cms:partial:shared/contact_box:"phone":"(562) 982-1337" }}
<h3>
  Average time to process application
  </h3>
  <p>
    Section 23987 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act requires the Department to mail a copy of each application to certain local officials. Section 23985 of the Act requires a 30-day posting period. Most investigations take approximately 45 to 50 days. The license can average about 75 days for a Person-to-Person transfer, and 90 days for an Original. Circumstances often result in a longer waiting period; therefore, before final approval and issuance of a license, caution should be used regarding extensive financial commitments, plans for grand openings, etc. If new construction or considerable remodeling is necessary, prior approval under Section 24044 should be sought before beginning any actual work.
  </p>
  <h3>
    License Renewal Period
  </h3>
  <p>
    All licenses are renewed on a 12 month basis. Renewals must be paid on or before the last day of the month posted on the license; no license will be transferred until the renewal fee is paid.
If your renewal was paid on time, you will receive your renewal license approximately 4 to 6 weeks after the expiration date on your current license.
Our License Query System (LQS) is updated soon after your expiration date. If your renewal was paid timely, the expiration date will update to show that your license does not expire until the following year. To access LQS, http://www.abc.ca.gov/datport/LQSMenu.html. It is recommended that you direct your distributors and those requiring proof of your license status to our query system. Many distributors and wholesalers already utilize this system regularly.
  </p>
  <h3>
    SALES TAX PERMIT
  </h3>
  <p>
    Each alcoholic beverage licensee must possess a seller's permit from the State Board of Equalization. It is a misdemeanor to sell in this State without such a permit.</p>
    {{ cms:partial:shared/link_box:"https://efile.boe.ca.gov/ereg/index.boe":"LEARN MORE":"Board of Equalization" }}
<h3>
  Transferring a liquor license
  </h3>
  <p>
    At the time of filing, an applicant for the transfer of either an off-sale general license, on-sale general license, off-sale beer and wine license, on-sale beer and wine license, on-sale beer license, or on-sale general license for seasonal business, shall present a copy of the Notice of Intention to Transfer (see ABC-227 or ABC-227-A) to the County Recorder, which shall be certified by the County Recorder in the county where the licensed premises are located.

  <h2>Business Improvement District Fees</h2>
  <p>Businesses located in Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) must pay additional fees in order to pay for the extra services that the BIDs provide to businesses in these areas.</p>

  <h2>Renewing your License</h2>
  <p>Annual licenses must be renewed every year. To verify your Business License you can call the hotline, email, or come in person to the Business License counter on the 4th floor of City Hall.</p>

  <h3>Renew Online</h3>
  <p>You can renew your license online by logging in with your e-account number. You can locate this number on your business license bill. There is a <strong>$5</strong> processing fee.</p>
  {{ cms:partial:shared/link_box:"https://paydirect.link2gov.com/LBCbuslicense/ItemSearch":"PAY":"Renewal Fee Online" }}

  <h3>Renew by Mail</h3>
  <p>For annual licenses, a renewal notice is mailed to the license address 14 days before the due date. You are still responsible for payment even if you do not receive a notice. The renewal reminder letter from the city includes instructions on how to pay by mail.</p>
  <h3>Mailing Address Change</h3>
  <p>
    If you change your mailing address during the year, contact the Business License Department to report the change.
  </p>
</div>
  <div class='readmore-section'>
  <h2>Late Fees</h2>
  <p>You have 14 days before the due date to pay for the renewal and then a grace period of 30 days after the due date before a penalty is assessed.</p>
  <p>You will be fined 25% of your amount due if you do not pay within 30 days of the due date. An additional 10% penalty will be added for each month the bill goes unpaid. The postmark date will determine whether or not your payment is delinquent.</p>
  <p>"Term" licenses are not renewed automatically, and close at the end of the license term you paid for. You need to contact us via email, phone, or in person to request the account be reactivated, then pay the tax assessment to get the renewed license.</p>

  <h2>Once I file an application, is the information available to the public?</h2>
  <p>All information on the Business License application is public record except information like your SSN, federal tax ID, and CDL number, all of which would not be provided in a public records act request. A subpoena would be required to obtain that information.
</p>
</div>
<div class='readmore-section'>
<h2>
  How Long Does the Approval Process Take?
  </h2>
  <p>
    It depends. You would need to speak with Development Services, Health, or Fire depending on what would be required based on your business location and the type of business you would like to conduct. Those are the departments that will take time with plans, inspections, corrections, permits etc. Business license would not be able to answer on a timeline for those departments since it is not their area of expertise.
