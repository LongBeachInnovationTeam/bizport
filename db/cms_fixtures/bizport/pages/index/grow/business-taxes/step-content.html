  {{ cms:shared:link_box:"https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Business-Taxes":"VIEW":"IRS Business Tax Information" }}
  <p>The form of business you operate determines what taxes you must pay and how you pay them. The following are the five general types of business taxes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Income Tax</li>
    <li>Estimated Taxes</li>
    <li>Self-Employment Tax</li>
    <li>Employment Taxes</li>
    <li>Excise Tax</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- <h3>Income Tax</h3>
  <p>All businesses except partnerships must file an annual income tax return. Partnerships file an information return. The form you use depends on how your business is organized. Refer to Business Structures to find out which returns you must file based on the business entity established.</p>
  <p>The federal income tax is a pay-as-you-go tax. You must pay the tax as you earn or receive income during the year. An employee usually has income tax withheld from his or her pay. If you do not pay your tax through withholding, or do not pay enough tax that way, you might have to pay estimated tax. If you are not required to make estimated tax payments, you may pay any tax due when you file your return. For additional information refer to Publication 583.</p>

  <h3>Estimated Taxes</h3>
  <p>Generally, you must pay taxes on income, including self-employment tax (discussed next), by making regular payments of estimated tax during the year. For additional information, refer to Estimated Taxes.</p>

  <h3>Self-Employment Tax</h3>
  <p>Self-employment tax (SE tax) is a social security and Medicare tax primarily for individuals who work for themselves. Your payments of SE tax contribute to your coverage under the social security system. Social security coverage provides you with retirement benefits, disability benefits, survivor benefits, and hospital insurance (Medicare) benefits.</p> -->
