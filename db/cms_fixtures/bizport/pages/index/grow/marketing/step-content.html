      Develop a few core messages that connect the dots between what you do and how it relates to your audience. Develop messages around a single idea. Keep language simple and use analogies or personal stories to get your point across. Make your messages believable. Provide evidence such as numbers to increase credibility.
    </li>
    <li>
      Be consistent with delivery. Each message you deliver should reflect your brand – that is, who you are. Highlight what is relevant to the issue and your audience, but be sure to include a consistent statement about your organization. This makes your messaging memorable and helps position you in the market and in the minds of your audience.
