  <h3>Zoning</h3>
  <p>Different business types are only allowed in certain parts of the city, and it is illegal to run a business in a building that is not permitted or zoned for that type of activity. Always check with the Cityâ€™s planning department before signing a lease.</p>

  <h2>COBA (City of Long Beach Council of Business Associations)</h2>
  <p>COBA gives business districts/associations a voice when there is any question or issue with City departments such as Planning, Building, Zoning, Licensing, Public Works, Fire, Water, and Health. They work with City departments to expedite all processes and make Long Beach a truly business friendly city.</p>
  {{ cms:partial:shared/link_box:"http://www.cobalb.com/":"VIEW":"COBA" }}
  
  <h3>Who makes up COBA?</h3>
  <p>COBA members are representatives from official Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) and associations from across the city. Any and all business areas in the city are encouraged to send a representative to the monthly COBA meetings to discuss issues that affect business in Long Beach. Best practices and resources are also shared among the group.</p>
  
  <h3>Business Improvement Districts (BIDs)</h3>
  <p>BIDs serve certain areas of Long Beach, coordinating a variety of services and activities to help businesses in their areas. The city requires businesses and property owners in these areas to pay an annual fee to their BID - usually a few hundred dollars. The city collects these fees and passes them on to the BIDS. In return, BIDs provide supplemental services not already provided by the city. Some clean the streets more rigorously, enhance security, host local events, represent business needs to the city, or provide other business support services.</p>
