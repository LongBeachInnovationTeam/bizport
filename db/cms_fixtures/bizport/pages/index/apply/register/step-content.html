  <h3>Register Your Business Name</h3>
  <p>Registering your company name is an optional step that will help protect the identity of your business. It ensures that similar businesses types canâ€™t register the same name. Registration fees vary based on your type of business, location, and number of employees.</p>

  <p>If you have chosen a name and want to make it official, register your FBN with the County of Los Angeles so you can start "Doing Business As" (DBA) your company.</p>

  <p>Applying for a fictitious business name (FBN) is the first piece of paperwork that you'll file for your business. It's best to finish writing a business plan, planning your finances, and selecting a location before you file. The application isn't free and you'll have to file more paperwork if you want to change your name later.</p>
  <h2>Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)</h2>
  <p>If you hire employees, you must apply for a Federal Employer Identification Number. If your business is a sole proprietorship, a FEIN may be helpful, but is not necessary.</p>
