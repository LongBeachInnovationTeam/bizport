  <h2>Home Based vs. Brick & Mortar</h2>
  <h3>
  What is best for your situation?
  </h3>
  <p>There are differences between starting a Home-Based Business and a Brick and Mortar. For example, if you’re starting a restaurant you may need a liquor license, zoning inspection, etc.</p>

  <h3>Brick & Mortar</h3>
  <p>There are a lot of things to take into account before signing the lease. Consider the following as you select a location for your business:</p>
  
  <h3>Square Footage</h3>
  <p>Consider the size of the property you need for your business: How much square footage do you need? Is there room for expansion? Check the city rules and fire codes to see how many people are allowed per square foot. What is comfortable size space for your customer size?</p>
  
  <h3>Parking Minimums</h3>
  <p>Each property has a number of parking spaces allotted to it. Ask the landlord how many spots are allotted. Parking minimums depend on the business type you are opening. Call the Planning and Building department to learn about the specific rules for parking. Ask "how much parking am I required to have for my type of business?</p>

  <h3>Site Plan</h3>
  <p>The city requires you to provide a site plan showing the interior and exterior layout of the business. Draw out how you want the layout of your building. Or you can hire an architect.</p>

  <h3>Internet Speed</h3>
  <p>Consider the internet connectivity of your location. The City of Long Beach is in the process of getting Google Fiber up and running, which will dramatically improve internet speeds. But in the meantime, some properties have weaker internet connections. Talk to the city to determine if the property you are considering falls under that.</p>
  
  <h3>Accessibility for Customers</h3>
  <p>Pick a location that your target customers can easily reach. Check out Walkscore to assess your property’s walkability, bikeability, and access to public transit.</p>

  <p>If you think most of your customers will drive, consider the parking minimums the city has placed on the property.</p>
  
  <h3>Rent</h3>
  <p>Make sure that you can afford the rent based on the revenue and cost expectations from your business plan.</p>
  
  <h3>Remodeling Costs and Time</h3>
  <p>You may need to do repairs or remodeling on the property before moving in. Look carefully to determine how much you might need to spend on this work before you can open your business. Hire a licensed architect for tenant improvement plans. The architect can also provide a fairly accurate cost estimate for the improvements. A professional contractor may be able to give you advice. The cost of certain improvements may be negotiated as part of the lease/rent agreement.</p>
  
  <h3>ADA Requirements</h3>
  <p>Figure out what the City and Federal requirements are for your business type. Height of the toilet, width of the door, there are specifications for everything. Learn as soon as possible about what these requirements are because they may impact the remodeling you need to do. The Federal standards require businesses to be fully accessible. The City requires a significant portion of your construction budget apply to accessibility upgrades.</p>
