  <h2>Certificate of Occupancy</h2>
  <p>Once all your inspections receive final approval and all permit related fees are paid the city will issue you a certificate of occupancy for your location. This certificate indicates that your building is up to code, the facilities meet city safety rules and allows for utilities (power, water, and gas) to be connected to the building. Your business license will also be approved.</p>
  <p>Even if no construction work was performed in preparing your business to open, you may still need to schedule some inspections and pay associated fees.</p>
  <p>You cannot get your business license until you get your certificate of occupancy first.</p>
