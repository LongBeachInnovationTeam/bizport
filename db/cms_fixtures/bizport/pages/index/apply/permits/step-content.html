  <h2>Purpose of Inspections</h2>
  <p>As you complete each phase of construction, you'll need to have city inspectors visit to ensure that the work meets the safety standards in the Long Beach city code.</p>
  <p>Common items to be inspected are foundation excavations, concrete work, wood framing, ventilation equipment, plumbing, electrical, shear wall nailing, roof nailing etc. You may need several inspections from each category as construction proceeds.</p>
  <p>Any work which requires a permit will require inspections.  When a permit is received, an Inspection Card will be issued. This card must be posted on the job site. The plans which were approved by the Department of Development Services must also be available during each inspection.</p>

  <h2>Schedule Inspection</h2>
  <p>Inspections can usually be scheduled for the next business day if you submit your request before 3pm. Requests made after 3pm will be scheduled 2-days after your request.</p>

<div class="step-section">
  <h2>Certificate of Occupancy</h2>
  <p>When you finish construction, you'll need a final inspection for the work you've completed to ensure safety for occupancy and connection of utility services.</p>
  <p>If there are no corrections, the inspector will approve the work and will authorize the connection of utility services, then issue a Certificate of Occupancy (CO) to the property owner.</p>
  <p>This final approval will allow you to begin using your location to do business.</p>
