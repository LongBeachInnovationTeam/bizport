  <h2>Permit Purpose</h2>
  <p>Permits are proof that your building and facilities follow city rules ("code") and are safe for you, your employees, and your customers.</p>

<p>
You will need to get permits to make changes to the building if your business needs to be renovated. You may also need to get a permit if there is a change in the character of the business uses even though no renovation is planned. In order to get permits, you must submit "plans" to the city.   </p>

<p>Certain types of business will require different permits and inspections from the Development Services, Fire, Health, and/or Police Departments.  </p>

<p>When Plan Check signs off on your plans and you have paid your permit fees, you will receive your Permits to make building alterations, and schedule Inspections.
