  <h2>Differences Between Licenses, Permits, and Inspections</h2>
  <strong>Licenses:</strong>
  <p>Licenses are the city’s way of keeping track of businesses, establishing a legal connection between businesses and their owners, and regulating certain types of commerce. The license fee is a tax that helps cover the cost of these and other services that the city provides to businesses.</p>
  <strong>Permits:</strong>
  <p>Permits are proof that your building and facilities follow city rules ("code") and are safe for you, your employees, and your customers.</p>
  <strong>Inspections:</strong>
  <p>As you complete each phase of construction, you'll need to have city inspectors visit to ensure that the work meets the health and safety standards in the Long Beach city code. Some inspections are performed before approval of a business license to ensure the site meets the health and safety standards of the City.</p>

  <h2>Applying for a Business License</h2>
  <p>You can obtain a business license by going to the 4th floor of Long Beach City Hall. Fill out the first page of the business license application and bring it to the Business License counter.</p>
  {{ cms:partial:shared/link_box:"http://www.longbeach.gov/finance/media-library/documents/business-info/business-licenses/business-license-application/":"VIEW":"Business License Application" }}
  <p>How long you would like to have your license and your total number of employees will determine your fee rate.</p>

  <h2>Annual vs. Term Licenses</h2>

  <h3>Annual Licenses</h3>
  <p>A business license is valid for one year from the date it was issued. It must be renewed each year. A renewal notice is sent to the license holder 14 days prior to the due date, and they have 30 days to pay without penalty. You are still responsible for payment by the due date even if you do not receive a notice. If you change your mailing address during the year, contact the Business License Department to report the change.</p>

  <h3>Short Term License</h3>
  <p>If your business location is in another city and you plan to do work in Long Beach, you are required to purchase an ‘out of city’ business license. The City recognizes the work may not last an entire year and offers pro-rated term licenses in three month increments.</p>

  TABLE

  <h3>Renewal and Late Fees</h3>
  <p>You have 14 days prior to the due date to pay the renewal and then 30 days after the 14 days before a penalty is assessed. It is not renewed automatically. At the end of the license term you paid for, the license automatically closes. You need to contact us via email, phone or in person to request the account be reactivated and pay the tax assessment to get the new license.</p>

  <h2>Additional Special Licenses</h2>
  <p>Some business types require additional special licenses to operate. Examples include food preparation, alcohol sales, tobacco sales, or massage services. City staff can tell you what licenses your business might need in order to operate.</p>

  <h3>Business License Classification</h3>
  <p>These business licenses cost different amounts.</p>

  <div>A = Contractors</div>
  <div>B = Manufacturing</div>
  <div>C = Miscellaneous Mobile</div>
  <div>D = Not used</div>
  <div>E = Professionals</div>
  <div>F = Recreation / Entertainment</div>
  <div>G = Rental  Residential Property</div>
  <div>H = Rental  Non-Residential Property</div>
  <div>I = Retailing</div>
  <div>J = Services</div>
  <div>K = Vending</div>
  <div>L = Wholesale</div>
  <div>M = Unique Businesses</div>
  <div>N = Banking/Insurance</div>

  <p>Within those classifications, Long Beach has around 250 different business license categories. The classifications drive our overall tax assessment structure. For each different classification a license would be required. For example, if you had a restaurant and had 2 pool tables in that restaurant that would fall under 2 classifications: one would be the restaurant, which would fall under class “I” (Retailing) and the pool tables would fall under class “M” (Unique Business), so in this scenario there would be 2 licenses required.</p>

  <p>These are the most common types of Business Licenses issued:</p>
