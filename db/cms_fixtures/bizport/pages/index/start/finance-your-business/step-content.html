  <h2>Capital</h2>
  <p>You have a plan, now you need money to cover your startup expenses and to sustain your business. This includes money to buy equipment as well as to cover any construction, permit or licensing fees.</p>
  <p>Starting a business can be expensive. Be sure that you prepare enough money to run your business for at least the first several months. It may take time to set up before you have enough customers to be profitable.</p>
  <p>
    Using the calculations and estimates from
    <a href="/start/business-plan">your business plan</a>
    , decide if you have enough money to begin, or if you need additional capital first. Lenders want to see that you have some of your own capital invested in your business.
  </p>
  <h3>Financial Projections</h3>
  <p>You will need financial projections for at least the first three years of operation.</p>

  <h2>Funding Sources</h2>
  <p>Here are some ways to get additional money if you need it:</p>
  <h3>Federal Loans</h3>
  <p>Fill out a short questionnaire and you can be matched with participating SBA Lenders through the LINC (Leveraging Information and Networks to access Capital) online referral tool. Submit your loan needs and LINC will connect you with lending partners and the SBA-backed financing programs to help get your business off the ground.</p>

  <h3>City Loans:</h3>
  <p>The City of Long Beach has a loan program for small businesses. City loans are based on the quality of your business plan as well as your resume and other personal qualifications. Credit score is part of the decision, but a low credit score might not prevent you from getting a loan.</p>

  <h3>Private Loans</h3>
  <p>Many banks will also give loans to small businesses. The requirements for these loans may be more demanding and interest rates may also be higher. You are encouraged to contact your bank for current rates and terms.</p>
  <p>If you don’t have good credit, you may be able to use a “loan guarantee” program to apply for private bank loans with lower credit requirements but a slightly higher interest rate. California’s State Treasurer and Small Business Financial Development Corporation (SBFDC) both operate loan guarantee programs for small businesses.</p>
