  <h2>Your Business License</h2>
  <h3>Display of License</h3>
  <p>Every person having a license shall prominently display the license at the place of business. If the business is operated from a vehicle, an identifying decal issued by the City shall be affixed to the vehicle, and the business license shall be carried by the licensee.  (L.B.M.C. 3.80.425.5) </p>

  <h2>Certificate of Occupancy</h2>
  <p>Once all your inspections receive final approval and all permit related fees are paid the city will issue you a certificate of occupancy for your location. This certificate indicates that your building is up to code, the facilities meet city safety rules and allows for utilities (power, water and gas) to be connected to the building. Your business license will also be approved.</p>
  <p>If no construction work was performed in preparing your business to open, you may still need to schedule some inspections and pay associated fees.</p>

  <h2>Employees</h2>
  <h3>Defining Employees</h3>
  <p>Every person engaged in the operation or conduct of any business in Long Beach, whether as owner, member of the owner’s family, partner, associate, agent, manager or solicitor, and every person employed or working in such business, whether full-time, part-time, permanent or temporary, for a wage, salary, commission or room and board.</p>
  <p>The owner of a sole proprietorship is not considered an "employee" of the business.</p>
  <h3>Workplace Posters</h3>
  <p>In California, all employers must meet workplace posting obligations. Workplace postings are usually available at no cost from the requiring agency. The Department of Industrial Relations requires employers to post information related to wages, hours and working conditions in an area frequented by employees where it may be easily read during the workday. Additional posting requirements apply to some workplaces. For a list of available safety and health postings, visit the Cal/OSHA publications page.</p>
