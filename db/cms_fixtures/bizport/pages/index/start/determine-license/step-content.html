  <h2>Do I need a Business License?</h2>
  <p>All entrepreneurs and vendors needs to get a business license before they operate their business.</p>
  <p>This includes very small businesses like pet sitting or selling cartoons on the beach.</p>
  <p>Home based businesses, non-profits, and independent contractors receiving a 1099 tax form are all examples of cases where you need a business license.</p>

  <h2>Lyft / Uber Drivers</h2>
  <p>Lyft, Uber and other Transportation Network Companies (TNC's) are overseen by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). The City of Long Beach is not allowed to license this type of business. The State of California licenses and oversees them. If you do work from your home for a TNC that does not involve driving, you will need to get a home-based business license. Also, if you live in Long Beach and do any business from your home, you must get a home-based business license.</p>

  <h2>Airbnb</h2>
  <p>Do folks that rent their properties on Airbnb need a business license?</p>
  <p>Currently no, we are not licensing Airbnb businesses since our current zoning ordinance does not allow for this type of use, so essentially all the Airbnb’s that are currently operating in Long Beach are doing so illegally. Our City Prosecutors are currently in litigation with some of these as we speak.</p>

  <h2>Enforcement</h2>
  <p>If we get a complaint that someone is doing business without a license, the city will send out an inspector to verify. The inspector needs to witness the violation occur. You then have to go in front of a judge who will determine penalty fee and jail time.</p>
  <p>If you are unsure if you need a business license, contact the city’s Business License Department:</p>
