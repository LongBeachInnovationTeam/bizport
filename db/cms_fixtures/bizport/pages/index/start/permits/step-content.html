  <h2>Permits</h2>
  <p>Permits are proof that your building and facilities follow city rules ("code") and are safe for you, your employees, and your customers.</p>
  <p>You will need to get permits to make changes to the building if your business needs to be renovated. You may also need to get a permit if there is a change in the character of the business uses even though no renovation is planned. In order to get permits, you must submit "plans" to the city.</p>
  <p>Certain types of business will require different permits and inspections from the Development Services, Fire, Health, and/or Police Departments.</p>

  <h2>Plans</h2>
  <p>Navigating construction rules and city code can be complicated. A professional architect or contractor may be able to offer helpful advice and planning assistance, as well as create necessary plans which include site plan drawings and construction documents (CDs).</p>
  <p>For large projects, you may need a licensed architect to “draw and stamp” your plans before showing them to city staff.</p>

  <h3>Plan Review</h3>
  <p>Bring your plans to the 4th floor of city hall. Complete a  Development Services Permit Application. Ask to submit your application and plans. Depending on the scope of your project you will need several sets for the different reviewers.</p>
  <p>You will first meet with a planner to review the plans for Zoning code review. Then you will meet with a staff Engineer who will look at your plans and determine how much time review will take.</p>
  <p>If your plans can be reviewed within 20 minutes you will be sent to the Plan Review counter. If the plans need a more thorough review they will be taken in for review by a Staff Engineer and put in the backlog.</p>

  <h3>Expedite Your Plan Review</h3>
  <p>The backlog exists to handle more complicated plan reviews. In some cases it can take up to 4 weeks.</p>
  <p>You have the option to expedite your plans, which will cut the review time in half. Expedite fees are double the normal fees.</p>

  <h3>Pick Up Your Plans</h3>
  <p>Once your plans have been reviewed, you may pick them up to make corrections.</p>
  <p>Bring them back to the 4th floor, and submit your corrections.</p>
  <p>When Plan Check signs off on your plans and you have paid your permit fees, you will receive your Permits to make building alterations, and schedule Inspections.</p>
