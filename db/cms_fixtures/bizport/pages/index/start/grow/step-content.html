  <h2>Certificate of Occupancy</h2>
  <p>Once all your inspections receive final approval and all permit related fees are paid the city will issue you a certificate of occupancy for your location. This certificate indicates that your building is up to code, the facilities meet city safety rules and allows for utilities (power, water, and gas) to be connected to the building. Your business license will also be approved.</p>
  <p>Even if no construction work was performed in preparing your business to open, you may still need to schedule some inspections and pay associated fees.</p>
  <p>You cannot get your business license until you get your certificate of occupancy first.</p>

  <h2>Pay Your Business Taxes</h2>
  {{ cms:shared:link_box:"https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Business-Taxes":"VIEW":"IRS Business Tax Information" }}
  <p>The form of business you operate determines what taxes you must pay and how you pay them. The following are the five general types of business taxes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Income Tax</li>
    <li>Estimated Taxes</li>
    <li>Self-Employment Tax</li>
    <li>Employment Taxes</li>
    <li>Excise Tax</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- <h3>Income Tax</h3>
  <p>All businesses except partnerships must file an annual income tax return. Partnerships file an information return. The form you use depends on how your business is organized. Refer to Business Structures to find out which returns you must file based on the business entity established.</p>
  <p>The federal income tax is a pay-as-you-go tax. You must pay the tax as you earn or receive income during the year. An employee usually has income tax withheld from his or her pay. If you do not pay your tax through withholding, or do not pay enough tax that way, you might have to pay estimated tax. If you are not required to make estimated tax payments, you may pay any tax due when you file your return. For additional information refer to Publication 583.</p>

  <h3>Estimated Taxes</h3>
  <p>Generally, you must pay taxes on income, including self-employment tax (discussed next), by making regular payments of estimated tax during the year. For additional information, refer to Estimated Taxes.</p>

  <h3>Self-Employment Tax</h3>
  <p>Self-employment tax (SE tax) is a social security and Medicare tax primarily for individuals who work for themselves. Your payments of SE tax contribute to your coverage under the social security system. Social security coverage provides you with retirement benefits, disability benefits, survivor benefits, and hospital insurance (Medicare) benefits.</p> -->
