  <h2>Calculate your finances</h2>
  <p>Starting a business can be expensive. Be sure that you prepare enough money to run your business for at least the first several months. It may take time to set up before you have enough customers to be profitable.</p>
    <p>Consider the money you need to cover your startup expenses and to sustain your business. This includes money to buy equipment as well as to cover any construction, permit or licensing fees.</p>
  <p>
    Using the calculations and estimates from
    <a href="/plan/business-plan">your business plan</a>
    , decide if you have enough money to begin, or if you need additional capital first. Lenders want to see that you have some of your own capital invested in your business.

  <h2>Funding Sources</h2>
  <p>Here are some ways to get additional money if you need it:</p>
   <h3>Funding Search Tool</h3>
 <p>
  Many local, state, and federal agencies provide other tax credits, loans and grants. Some of these offerings are targeted for certain types of businesses.  </p>

  <h3>City Loans</h3>
  <p>The City of Long Beach has a loan program for small businesses. City loans are based on the quality of your business plan as well as your resume and other personal qualifications. Credit score is part of the decision, but a low credit score might not prevent you from getting a loan.</p>

  <h3>Grants</h3>
  <p>
    Grants are money given to you that you do not have to pay back. The money is sometimes restricted to certain uses, like repainting the front of a store or buying better equipment. Some grants are given in cash, while others pay you back (“reimburse” you) for money that you spend.</p>
    <h4>
  Business Start-Up Grant
  </h4>
  <p>
   This grant is designed to assist new businesses by providing federal grant funds in an effort to defray costs associated with the starting of the business. The program may provide up to a $2,000 reimbursement grant to eligible businesses.</p>
