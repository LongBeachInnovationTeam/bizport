BizPort is a business portal composed from common and readily-available open source code and tools. It contains a content management system (CMS) for easy editing of site content, as well as a rich set of features for customers starting a business. 

A redeployment of BizPort as a city business portal requires:
• Technical setup: BizPort is designed to be easily redeployed and customized by a single full-stack engineer familiar with a modern open-source language like Ruby or Python.
• Content development: What makes a business portal valuable for customers is the relevance and accuracy of content. A UX researcher, service designer, or program manager can help to coordinate across multiple business-facing departments in city hall to build high-quality content.
• Ongoing maintenance: Both content and code will require updates and continued development over time. While this will require less bandwidth than the initial site setup, it should be considered in long-term staffing requirements to ensure that the site does not fall out of date, become irrelevant to customer needs, or develop security vulnerabilities.

This document focuses on the first of these three points, technical setup, and is intended for non-technical city management making strategic decisions about how to deploy a business portal in their city.
