# BizPort Business Portal

BizPort is an open-source codebase that you can use to set up a business portal in any city. It was originally built for the City of Long Beach, California. You can visit their live version at bizport.longbeach.gov.

If you're a **city staff member or strategist** that wants to redeploy the site in your city, have a look at the [guide to redeployment](https://github.com/codeforamerica/bizport/blob/master/docs/REDEPLOYMENT.md).

If you're a **developer** trying to set up BizPort on your own laptop or in production, check out the [developer docs](https://github.com/codeforamerica/bizport/blob/master/docs/DEVELOPER_SETUP.md).

If you're a **content editor** learning how to edit copy in the content management system (CMS), the [content editing docs](https://github.com/codeforamerica/bizport/blob/master/docs/EDITING.md) are a great place to start.

BizPort is open source under the MIT License, which you are encouraged to read in its entirety [here](https://github.com/codeforamerica/bizport/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
