        Applying for a fictitious business name (FBN) is the first piece of paperwork that you'll file for your business. It's best to finish

        , 
        %a{ href: start_finance_your_business_path } planning your finances

        %a{ href: start_find_a_location_path } selecting a location
        before you file, since the application isn't free and you'll have to file more paperwork if you want to change your name later.
