      %p As you complete each phase of construction, you'll need to have city inspectors visit to ensure that the work meets the safety standards in the Long Beach city code.

      %p There are several types of inspections, including fire, plumbing, health, mechanical, and electric. You may have to have several inspections from each category as construction proceeds. When you finish construction, you'll need a final inspection for each category of work you've done.

      %p The cost of these inspections is included in the fees you paid with your permit applications.
