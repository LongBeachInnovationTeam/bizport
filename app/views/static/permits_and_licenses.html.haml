          %p Some business types require special licenses to operate. Examples include food preparation, alcohol sales, tobacco sales, or massage services. City staff can tell you what licenses your business might need in order to operate.

          %h5 Permits
          %p Permits are proof that your building and facilities follow city rules ("code") and are safe for you, your employees, and your customers.

          If you are starting a business in a building that needs to be renovated, you will need to get permits to make changes. In order to get permits, you must submit drawings ("plans") and construction documents to the city.

          Construction rules can be complicated. A professional architect or contractor may be able to offer helpful advice and planning assistance, as well as create necessary site plan drawings and construction documents (CDs). For large projects, you may need a licensed architect to approve your plans before showing them to city staff.

          In order to apply for permits, you will need:
